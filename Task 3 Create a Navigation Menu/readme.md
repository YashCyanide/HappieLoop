### Navigation Structure

The navigation menu is structured using HTML with a list (`<ul>`) of menu items (`<li>`). Dropdown functionality is implemented using nested lists for submenus.

### Styling Choices

- The navigation menu has a blue background color (`#3498db`) for a modern and appealing look.
- Menu items are styled with bold white text, and dropdown menus have a slightly different shade.
- Media queries are used to adapt the menu for smaller screens, providing a better mobile experience.

### JavaScript Interaction

- JavaScript is used to handle the opening and closing of dropdown menus.
- Clicking on a menu item with a dropdown toggles the display of the associated submenu.
- Clicking outside of the dropdown closes any open submenus.

### Accessibility

- The navigation menu is designed to be accessible for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- The dropdowns can be navigated using the keyboard, and screen readers will convey the structure and content effectively.

### Testing

- The navigation menu has been tested on different screen sizes and devices to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience.

### Browser Compatibility

- The navigation menu has been verified to work consistently across various web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
