# Contact Form Project

This project provides a simple and styled contact form with basic validation and confirmation message functionality. It's a starting point that you can use in your web projects to allow users to send messages through a contact form.

## Features

- HTML form structure with fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- CSS styling with a green shades theme to enhance the form's appearance.
- JavaScript code for form submission handling and confirmation message display.
- Basic form validation to ensure required fields are filled.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-form.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Customize the form fields, styles, and JavaScript as needed for your project.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Fill out the form fields (name, email, subject, message).

3. Click the "Submit" button.

4. The form will either display a confirmation message or alert you if there are validation errors.

## Customization

- **Form Fields:** Adjust the form fields in the HTML file to match your specific requirements.
